**Hi, I'm Kunal!** 

I'm a undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying computer science!

I love building projects, particularly those that involve computer vision, robotics, and general full-stack engineering.

My favorite projects:

- [Smart Surveillance](https://github.com/kdutta9/Smart-Surveillance): A security camera that sends text alerts when it detects motion.
- [Shot Tracker](https://github.com/kdutta9/ShotTracker): A mobile app that can track a user's basketball shots.
- [Privacy Guard](https://github.com/kdutta9/PrivacyGuard): A mobile app and browser extension that detects the opening of a user's door, and then closes the user's incognito tabs.
